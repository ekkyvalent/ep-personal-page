# EP Personal Page
A simple, responsive single static web page about myself. I made the page as a showcase of my newly-gained front-end skills and it will be constantly updated with new features as my skill improving. The page utilizes [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework with a little [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) polish here and there. I hope to inspire fellow new front-end web developers to design their own personal page.

## Getting Started
To begin playing and tinkering with my project, kindly use one of the following methods:
* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ekkyvalent/ep-personal-page.git`
* Download the zip file and extract in any directory
* Fork the repo

To open the sample page, simply extract the zip (if you're not cloning the repo) to any directory and click the `index.html` file. Or, if you have a bit of a tinkerer side, you can run an ad hoc http static server (http://localhost:8000) directly from a specified directory, simply by running these python commands:

__Python 2.x__

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

__Python 3.x__

`$ python -m http.server 8000`

Other commands from other languanges are listed [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).

Please keep in mind that you must be connected to the internet for the page in order for jQuery script and some fonts to work.
