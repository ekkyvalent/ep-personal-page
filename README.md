# EP Personal Page
A simple, responsive single static web page about myself. I made the page as a showcase of my newly-gained front-end skills and it will be constantly updated with new features as my skill improving. The page utilizes [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework with a little [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) polish here and there. I hope to inspire fellow new front-end web developers to tinker with my page

## Getting Started
